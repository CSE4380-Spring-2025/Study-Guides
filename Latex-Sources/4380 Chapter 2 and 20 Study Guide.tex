\section{Chapter 2: Cryptographic Tools}

\subsection{Symmetric Encryption}
\subsubsection{Confidentiality with Symmetric Encryption}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
    \item Common symmetric encryption algorithms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{DES (Data Encryption Standard)}: 64-bit block size, 56-bit key.
        \item \textbf{Triple DES (3DES)}: Applies DES three times with two or three keys, increasing key length to 112 or 168 bits.
        \item \textbf{AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)}: 128-bit block size, key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Block Ciphers vs. Stream Ciphers}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Block ciphers process data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 64 or 128 bits).
        \item Stream ciphers process data continuously, one bit or byte at a time.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Message Authentication and Hash Functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Message Authentication Code (MAC)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A small block of data generated using a secret key and a message.
        \item Used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hash Functions}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Secure hash functions (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3) produce fixed-size hash values from variable-length input data.
        \item Properties of secure hash functions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pre-image resistance: Hard to reverse the hash.
            \item Second pre-image resistance: Hard to find another input with the same hash.
            \item Collision resistance: Hard to find two different inputs with the same hash.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Public-Key Encryption}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Public-Key Cryptography}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
        \item Common algorithms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{RSA}: Based on the difficulty of factoring large integers.
            \item \textbf{Diffie-Hellman}: Used for key exchange.
            \item \textbf{Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)}: Provides similar security to RSA with smaller key sizes.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Digital Signatures}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document.
        \item Created by encrypting a hash of the message with the sender's private key.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Random and Pseudorandom Numbers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Random numbers are crucial for key generation and cryptographic operations.
    \item \textbf{Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generate sequences of numbers that appear random but are deterministic.
        \item Used in cryptographic applications where true randomness is not feasible.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Practical Applications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Encryption of Stored Data}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Encrypting data at rest (e.g., on hard drives, tapes) to protect it from unauthorized access.
        \item Common tools: PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), hardware-based encryption appliances.
