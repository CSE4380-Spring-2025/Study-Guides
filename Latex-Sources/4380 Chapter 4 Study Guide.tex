\begin{document}

\maketitle


\section{Access Control Principles}
\subsection{Access Control Context}
Access control is a fundamental aspect of computer security, ensuring that only authorized entities can access specific resources. It involves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication}: Verifying the credentials of a user or system entity.
    \item \textbf{Authorization}: Granting rights or permissions to access resources.
    \item \textbf{Audit}: Reviewing system records to ensure compliance and detect security breaches.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Access Control Policies}
Access control policies dictate who or what can access specific resources and the type of access permitted. Policies are categorized into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discretionary Access Control (DAC)}: Access is based on the identity of the requestor and access rules.
    \item \textbf{Mandatory Access Control (MAC)}: Access is based on security labels and clearances.
    \item \textbf{Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)}: Access is based on user roles within the system.
    \item \textbf{Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)}: Access is based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Subjects, Objects, and Access Rights}
\subsection{Subjects}
A \textbf{subject} is an entity capable of accessing objects, typically equated with a process. Subjects are categorized into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Owner}: Creator or administrator of a resource.
    \item \textbf{Group}: Named group of users with specific access rights.
    \item \textbf{World}: Users not included in owner or group categories.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objects}
An \textbf{object} is a resource to which access is controlled, such as files, directories, or devices.

\subsection{Access Rights}
Access rights describe how a subject may access an object, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Read}: View information.
    \item \textbf{Write}: Modify or delete data.
    \item \textbf{Execute}: Run programs.
    \item \textbf{Delete}: Remove resources.
    \item \textbf{Create}: Generate new resources.
    \item \textbf{Search}: List or search directories.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discretionary Access Control (DAC)}
\subsection{Access Control Model}
DAC allows entities to grant access rights to others. It is implemented using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Access Control Lists (ACLs)}: Lists users and their permitted access rights for each object.
    \item \textbf{Capability Tickets}: Specify authorized objects and operations for a user.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protection Domains}
A \textbf{protection domain} is a set of objects with access rights. Domains can be static or dynamic, allowing processes to have different access rights at different times.

\section{Example: Unix File Access Control}
\subsection{Traditional UNIX File Access Control}
UNIX uses a hierarchical file system with permissions for owner, group, and others. Special permissions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SetUID}: Temporarily grants the user the rights of the file owner.
    \item \textbf{SetGID}: Temporarily grants the user the rights of the file group.
    \item \textbf{Sticky Bit}: Restricts file deletion to the owner.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Access Control Lists in UNIX}
Modern UNIX systems support extended ACLs, allowing more flexible access control by assigning permissions to named users and groups.

\section{Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)}
\subsection{RBAC Reference Models}
RBAC assigns access rights to roles rather than individual users. The NIST RBAC standard defines four models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RBAC$_0$}: Base model with users, roles, permissions, and sessions.
    \item \textbf{RBAC$_1$}: Adds role hierarchies.
    \item \textbf{RBAC$_2$}: Adds constraints.
    \item \textbf{RBAC$_3$}: Combines RBAC$_1$ and RBAC$_2$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Role Hierarchies}
Role hierarchies allow roles to inherit permissions from subordinate roles, reflecting organizational structures.

\subsection{Constraints}
Constraints restrict role assignments and permissions, such as mutually exclusive roles and cardinality limits.

\section{Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)}
\subsection{Attributes}
ABAC uses attributes of subjects, objects, and the environment to make access control decisions. Attributes include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Subject Attributes}: Characteristics of the user or process.
    \item \textbf{Object Attributes}: Characteristics of the resource.
    \item \textbf{Environment Attributes}: Contextual information like time or location.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ABAC Logical Architecture}
ABAC evaluates access requests based on predefined rules and attributes, providing fine-grained access control.

\subsection{ABAC Policies}
Policies define rules for access based on attributes, allowing for flexible and dynamic access control.

\section{Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM)}
\subsection{Identity Management}
ICAM manages digital identities and attributes, ensuring trustworthy identities across applications.

\subsection{Credential Management}
Credentials bind identities to tokens, such as smart cards or digital certificates, and are managed throughout their lifecycle.

\subsection{Access Management}
Access management ensures that entities are granted appropriate access to resources based on their identity and attributes.

\subsection{Identity Federation}
Identity federation allows organizations to trust digital identities and attributes from external sources, facilitating collaboration.

\section{Trust Frameworks}
\subsection{Traditional Identity Exchange Approach}
Traditional identity exchange involves agreements between identity service providers and relying parties, ensuring trust in shared identity information.

\subsection{Open Identity Trust Framework (OITF)}
OITF provides a standardized approach to identity and attribute exchange, ensuring trust and security in digital transactions.

\section{Case Study: RBAC System for a Bank}
The Dresdner Bank implemented an RBAC system to manage access to various applications. Roles were defined by job function and position, with access rights assigned based on roles. The system improved security and reduced administrative overhead.
